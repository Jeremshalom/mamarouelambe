          Mama Ruel, you are one person in life who believe in hard work and
          determination to succeed. Even on your sick bed you were determined to
          show you were strong and better. You were very attached to Bala, but
          when God spoke to ensure your home calling transition. We all bowed
          and wished your soul Peace and eternal Rest

          Oh, how have the mighty fallen. Yes, the demise of auntie Ruel Leneke
          is to liken to mighty falling because she was an icon of monumental
          proportions. Her sojourn on earth had brought out her sterling
          qualities which have left indelible mark in the sand of time. Our
          auntie was loving, caring to her children, her siblings, relatives and
          to the generality of people at large. She will be remembered for her
          compassion for the weak, the vulnerable, the needy. She toiled and got
          connected to God and did marvelous works in the vineyard of the Lord
          which stand as testimonies of her relationship to her creator. Adieu
          our benevolent, caring and loving mother. Surely, we shall soon meet
          at the foot of the Lord and to part no more.

          Mama na, my sweet mother you're gone hmmm it is well. Mama, I know you
          suffered on that sick bed. Seeing you in that state was not an easy
          sight to behold. My prayer and wish were to see you back on your feet
          for us to have a good time together again but, the all-knowing God
          that wants the best for you deemed it fit to call you back home to
          rest. Who am I to question His doings? You were such a loving mother
          to me and my family I really appreciate God for the beautiful years
          shared. Was it the blessings you always showered on me whenever we
          were together? Your motherly prayers indeed worked for me. Space here
          is not enough to say all you meant to me. I love you mama. Rest in
          peace sweet mother.

          Anty as we started calling her as far back as when I was 8years was
          truly an amazing woman. I remember her for being extremely neat &
          couldn’t stand clumsy or untidy places. I also remembered how she
          ensured mama got VIP treatment in the hospital when Manadi was to be
          born. She & Mama Magda both stayed beside mama throughout the lab our
          from the previous evening to the morning of the birth. Mama Fibi would
          also drop me to stay with her whenever she had to travel. I enjoyed a
          warm relationship with her growing up and into adulthood. She called
          my dad sogi which was the first place I learned how to say in law in
          Bwatiye. She knew my children by their names and anytime we spoke or
          saw would ask of each of them. After we got the news of mama’s call to
          glory, we joked that mama Fibi would say Ruel, ye Tula yo? She would
          answer ah sister hun Tula and would sit to confer under the tree as
          they used to, singing hymns as they loved to & even dancing. Mama, you
          did well. You fought the good fight. I believe you have kept the
          promise. Rest well till the resurrection morning. Sincerely, with
          grateful heart to the lord for your life.

          Mama, I had wished I could come over again to visit you at least one
          more time; but, alas! This is one of those situations that beg for the
          cliché, 'man proposes, God dispose! Circumstances unforeseen hindered.
          I will always remember our times together, when our shared love,
          Millie, was ill; we prayed together, laughed together, shared
          responsibilities together, and got to know ourselves better! You grew
          to have confidence in me and took me as part of you indeed. I too
          believed in your love! Thank you. <br />
          I will not forget how we would sit, and crack eat 'biara' (groundnuts)
          together 😉! That's when I discovered that you loved 'arachide'
          (groundnuts) too👍! <br />
          You were a solid support to our family and ministries, and you
          mobilized your friends to do the same! Your labour of love shall not
          be forgotten. <br />
          I am missing you, and your grandchildren are also. We however take
          consolation in the hope that we shall see you again when we meet in
          the eternal presence of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave
          Himself for our sins, as it is written, to deliver us from this
          present evil world, according to the will of His Father. We are
          striving towards that goal, counting on His grace. In the meantime,
          sleep well, until He comes. And He is coming soon! ADIEU MAMA! We love

          Hmmm sister. You have gone too soon. What can I say? When I heard the
          news of your transition to glory, it came to me unexpectedly and as a
          rude shock. I was praying that it wasn't true but lo and behold it
          was. In my mind's eye, you still had some more years on earth but that
          was my thoughts for you not God's plan. You have been a mother indeed.
          'Sister' as I boldly called you will be missed. I remember the day I
          called you ‘mama ‘and you said ' Pinky! Is that you? When did you
          come? '. I said 'No, it was me Parky ‘You then asked me if I had ever
          called you ' mama ' and I said ' yes '. You answered and said that I
          have never called you ' *mama* ‘but ‘*sister* ' since the death of our
          dad and that I'm the only one who calls you ' sister '. Now who will I
          call ' Sister '? You didn't get the chance to see the twins except
          when they were young, but now they are grown up. Even in your old age,
          you will call to check on us asking how we were faring. We will come
          for holidays, and you want to add to us transport money and when we
          say’ no' even when we have, you will still insist. You insist that we
          collect it and then you start bombarding us with calls to ask if we
          have arrived home safely. What a mother you were. Sister ‘your
          departure has left a vacuum in our hearts and will be hard to fill.

          Granny, my Love, words just fail me now… You would give anything for
          me, you would do everything for me; that, I say in full confidence and
          assurance. Thank you for embodying unconditional motherly love. You
          are an irreplaceable grandma! I am privileged to bear and cherish a
          whole panoply of amazing memories, from childhood right into my
          adulthood! Rest on daughter of the “Most High”. Till we meet again, in
          Eternal Glory, never to part ways.

          Mama, my dearest mama, you were my mother, friend and confidant. You
          loved me as if there was only me to love. You told me so several times
          right from childhood to this moment. You made me part of whatever you
          were doing. You were very decisive, jovial, diligent, modest, clean,
          you loved singing, gardening and were an activist of Christianity. You
          were humble. What you went through would have broken a thousand men. I
          thank God so much for your life and that is why I am not mourning but
          celebrating. Thank you so much for everything. <br />
          I promise you our secrets will remain so to my last breath.

          My Wonder Woman <br />
          You have gone yonder, but my comfort is that it is a better place a
          place of rest, radiance, and glory. <br />
          Though gone, memories of you remain with me. Memories that always made
          me marvel at the wonder that you were. I wondered at the brilliance of
          your brain, at how you understood the different things I talked about
          even at your advanced age, and at how you could quote me verbatim!
          Just terrific! <br />
          I wondered at how you could decode our French codes when my siblings
          and I didn't want you to know what we were talking about. I wondered
          at the strength you displayed when your daughter went through pain,
          illness, and imminent death. I wondered at your achievements back in
          the day: educated, talented, wealthy, well-connected, independent,
          intellectual, and how you excelled in everything you did. I wondered
          at your beauty. Looking at your photographs always kept me admiring
          you. And somewhere in my heart, I wished I had your beauty. I wondered
          at your heart. Even when you didn't have much, you were more than
          willing to share with me the little you could afford. <br />
          I wondered at your boldness in driving. I must confess that your
          fearless driving spurred mine. I wondered at your level of hygiene. Oh
          Granny, no one surpasses you! <br />
          I wondered at your love for Coke. Unfailing! LOL. I could go on, but
          I'll pause here to tuck the rest in my heart. <br />
          Till we see again, in glory.

          It breaks my heart to know that you are gone my Kaka. I was planning
          on coming to visit, just to hear of your departure.
          <br />But I cherish every moment I (we) had with you. From our
          holidays at your place in Yola, to your visits in Cotonou and many
          more. Your doggedness, resilience and much more your neatness have
          robbed off on me. So many things to say about you my kaka <br />This
          hurts me a lot but I am also comforted that you are in a better place.

          <br />Till we meet again Granny,

          <br />With so much love, your first granddaughter, your namesake.

          In Loving Memory of Aunty Rouel <br />
          Today, we gather to honor and remember the life of our beloved Aunt,
          whose presence in our lives was a beacon of love, kindness, and joy.
          <br />
          Aunty Rouel had a unique way of making everyone feel special. Her warm
          smile and gentle demeanor were a comfort to all, and her laughter
          could light up any room. She was always ready with a kind word or a
          helping hand, never hesitating to offer support and encouragement.
          <br />
          Her life was a testament to the power of love. Aunty dedicated herself
          to her family and friends, always putting others before herself.
          <br />
          Her wisdom and guidance were invaluable. Whether it was through her
          stories, her advice, or her unwavering belief in us, Aunty had a way
          of touching our lives in profound and lasting ways. <br />
          Though Aunty is no longer with us in body, her spirit remains. We find
          comfort in knowing that her love surrounds us still. <br />
          We are grateful for the time we had with her and for the countless
          ways she enriched our lives. As we say goodbye, we do so with hearts
          full of love and gratitude for the incredible person she was and the
          lasting impact she made on us all. <br />
          Rest in peace, dear Aunty Rouel. Your legacy lives on in our hearts,
          and you will always be remembered with love and affection.
