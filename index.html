          <h1>Biography</h1>
          <p>
            Mama Rouel Judith Ambe was born to Mr. Yohanna Ambe Kakai (Evg/Sgt
            Major) and Mama Abigail Tazugrati Ambe on January 13, 1936, in Numan
            Local Government Area, Adamawa state, Nigeria. She was the second
            child among her siblings; Yosi Ambe, Vedan Ambe, Kanti Ambe, Helen
            Love Owuna, Felicia Allen, Lawrence Yapaha, Ishaku Ambe, and Hanatu
            Ambe, all of whom are of blessed memory. Mama Rouel Ambe grew up in
            Numan and attended Girls Boarding School (CBS) now Boronum. She
            furthered her education at WTC Maiduguri, Borno state, and
            subsequently proceeded to Wusasa School of Nursing, Kaduna state.
            Upon completing her studies, she returned to work with Sudan United
            Mission Hospital (SUM), Numan. In 1959, she got married to late Mr.
            Abel Tula Leneke, and they had two children: Mr. Bala Vincent Leneke
            and the late Mrs. Mildred Ohanete (née Leneke). Mama Rouel Ambe was
            a seasoned, registered, and accomplished nurse who worked in nearly
            all departments within the nursing profession, making it a field of
            envy. After her initial appointment at SUM Hospital in Numan, she
            advanced her career at Kaduna Teaching Hospital and later at Nursing
            Home Maiduguri. Another notable position she held was at Chester
            Infirmary Hospital in the UK. She was the pioneer Principal of the
            Nursing and Midwifery School in Bauchi. Throughout her career, she
            held various significant positions, including Executive Secretary of
            the Women's Commission in Adamawa State, Sole Administrator of Güyük
            Local Government, Chief Nursing Officer in charge of the Health
            Services Management Board, Head of the Nursing Department at the
            Ministry of Health in Adamawa State, State and Regional Manager of
            the Planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria, and Adamawa State
            Chairperson of the Inter-Africa Committee (IAC). She attended
            numerous seminars and workshops, both locally and internationally,
            in countries such as the Gambia, USA, UK, Ethiopia, and Ghana, where
